Video title: Making of Song: Dama Dam Mast Kalandar | Movie: David| Releasing 1st Feb, 2013
	Video description: Recreating one of our subcontinent's most popular qawwalis wasn't an easy ride, but Team David took it up and created the stunner that is Damadam Mast Kalandar. This video goes behind the scenes into composer Mikey McCleary's studio, charting how he's tried to give the track a unique, Carribean-esque rhythm. It then talks about Director Bejoy's signature idea of pitting a soundtrack against action-packed visuals, in this case both a marriage and a caged wrestling fight.

Watch the grace of Sarika come alive to the electro soul of Mikey McCleary.. and don't miss Milind Soman and Nikhil Chinappa in the video!

Video title: Hollywood Movie: Lincoln- Trailer | Releasing in India: 8th February, 2013
	Video description: In 1865, as the American Civil War winds inexorably toward conclusion, U.S. president Abraham Lincoln endeavors to achieve passage of the landmark constitutional amendment which will forever ban slavery from the United States. However, his task is a race against time, for peace may come at any time, and if it comes before the amendment is passed, the returning southern states will stop it before it can become law. Lincoln must, by almost any means possible, obtain enough votes from a recalcitrant Congress before peace arrives and it is too late. Yet the president is torn, as an early peace would save thousands of lives. As the nation confronts its conscience over the freedom of its entire population, Lincoln faces his own crisis of conscience -- end slavery or end the war.

Upon visiting the doctor Abhi finds out that Shruti can be cured, but she might not remember anything of her visit to Phoolbari, her friends or even Abhi. Shruti is disheartened to hear this and persuades Abhi to promise her that he will never leave her, even if she is cured and is not able to remember him. 

Agnidev Roy gets furious when he learns of Shruti's relationship with Abhi and reaches Phoolbari with his goons. The people of Phoolbari oppose Agnidev. Looking at this situation he agrees to get Shruti and Abhi engaged, but cunningly thrashes Abhi at a remote place and takes his daughter back to Kolkata. When Abhi goes to meet Shruti, she fails to recognize him. She is now cured and is set off to be engaged with someone else. But Abhi, had given a word to his beloved that he would never leave her.

Video title: Deewana  Dialogue Promo 1
	Video description: Deewana is a forthcoming Bengali film directed by Ravi Kinagi starring Jeet and Srabanti in the lead roles. Deewana is a love story of Abhi (Jeet) a funloving and popular boy from Phoolbari, a small township in North Bengal and Shruti (Srabanti) daughter of Agnidev Roy (Bharat Kaul), a dreaded mafia from Kolkata, who sends his daughter to Phoolbari on a vacation. Abhi takes an instant liking for Shruti the moment he sets his eyes on her. Gradually, Shruti starts to enjoy Abhi's company and the fondness between them grows.

One day, Abhi finds out that Shruti is suffering from 'post traumatic event disorder' and she has no memory of the last three years. Upon visiting the doctor Abhi finds out that Shruti can be cured, but she might not remember anything of her visit to Phoolbari, her friends or even Abhi. Shruti is disheartened to hear this and persuades Abhi to promise her that he will never leave her, even if she is cured and is not able to remember him. 

Agnidev Roy gets furious when he learns of Shruti's relationship with Abhi and reaches Phoolbari with his goons. The people of Phoolbari oppose Agnidev. Looking at this situation he agrees to get Shruti and Abhi engaged, but cunningly thrashes Abhi at a remote place and takes his daughter back to Kolkata. When Abhi goes to meet Shruti, she fails to recognize him. She is now cured and is set off to be engaged with someone else. But Abhi, had given a word to his beloved that he would never leave her. How he tries relentlessly to convince her and what happens with Shruti forms the rest of the story.

Deewana releases in cinemas on 18th January, 2013.
