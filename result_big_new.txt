Video title: Making of Song: Dama Dam Mast Kalandar | Movie: David| Releasing 1st Feb, 2013
	Video description: Recreating one of our subcontinent's most popular qawwalis wasn't an easy ride, but Team David took it up and created the stunner that is Damadam Mast Kalandar. This video goes behind the scenes into composer Mikey McCleary's studio, charting how he's tried to give the track a unique, Carribean-esque rhythm. It then talks about Director Bejoy's signature idea of pitting a soundtrack against action-packed visuals, in this case both a marriage and a caged wrestling fight.

Watch the grace of Sarika come alive to the electro soul of Mikey McCleary.. and don't miss Milind Soman and Nikhil Chinappa in the video!

Video title: Hollywood Movie: Lincoln- Trailer | Releasing in India: 8th February, 2013
	Video description: In 1865, as the American Civil War winds inexorably toward conclusion, U.S. president Abraham Lincoln endeavors to achieve passage of the landmark constitutional amendment which will forever ban slavery from the United States. However, his task is a race against time, for peace may come at any time, and if it comes before the amendment is passed, the returning southern states will stop it before it can become law. Lincoln must, by almost any means possible, obtain enough votes from a recalcitrant Congress before peace arrives and it is too late. Yet the president is torn, as an early peace would save thousands of lives. As the nation confronts its conscience over the freedom of its entire population, Lincoln faces his own crisis of conscience -- end slavery or end the war.

Department of the Army. Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. US Army Audiovisual Center. (ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). "THE BIG PICTURE" reports on Army progress during the past year -- This episode of THE BIG PICTURE presents a report to the Nation on the new United States Army taking shape and the accomplishments that are making it possible. With the coming of atomic weapons to the battlefield, armies as heretofore known have been rendered obsolete and inadequate. They must be considered a thing of the past. Skillfully edited, "Progress -- US Army," shows how old ideas are giving way to the onslaught of new capabilities, and out of the experimentation is being forged the new Army -- an Atomic Army -- bringing with it new concepts and fantastic weapons with which to fulfill its peacetime objective: A maximum capability to deter war. Narrated by Mr. Alexander Scourby and musically scored by the United States Army Field Band, "Progress -- US Army" is a particularly effective documentary on the Army of 1957.

Video title: Beachhead Anzio pt1-2 1963 US Army World War II The Big Picture
	Video description: more at quickfound.net "DOCUMENTS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ALLY BEACHHEAD AT ANZIO IN WORLD WAR II." Public domain film from the National Archives, slightly cropped to remove uneven edges, with the aspect ratio corrected, and mild video noise reduction applied. The soundtrack was also processed with volume normalization, noise reduction, clipping reduction, and equalization (the resulting sound, though not perfect, is far less noisy than the original).

The operation was commanded by American Major General John P. Lucas and was intended to outflank German forces of the Winter Line and enable an attack on Rome. The resulting combat is commonly called the Battle of Anzio. The success of an amphibious landing at that location, in a basin substantially comprising reclaimed marshland and surrounded by mountains, depended completely on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could move relative to the reaction time of the defenders. Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders.

Video title: Singham - Trailer Full HD
	Video description: Singham Bajirao Singham (Ajay Devgn) is a police sub- inspector who hails from a small town of Shivgad in Maharashtra. He fights against corruption with the valor of lion. When Kavya (Kaajal Aggarwal) comes to Shivgad, from Goa to visit her grandparents on a vacation she is charmed by Bajirao's bold and courageous demeanor. Everything goes well for Singham until there is a clash with a goon that eventually escalates into a full blown fight. Singham eventually gets promoted & is transferred to Goa which also happens to be the operational hub of the goon. While this move brings Singham closer to Kavya, it also brings him in the clutches of the very same goon who is on a mission to destroy him. How Singham rises to the challenge to expose this crook and put an end to his malicious activities forms the rest of the story.

It's a Firefox (3.0) plugin which has close ties into Google Reader. There are so many features to outline with Feedly, that it was difficult to keep this video short. Even after it, I wasn't able to cover all the cool things about it. From keyboard shortcuts, annotations, view customizations, and social hooks, Feedly has changed the game almost overnight. Will it replace Google Reader? That's hard to say, but it definitely compliments it in ways that's hard to explain. The scary thing is, it's only getting better. So give Feedly a shot by going to www.feedly.com. Enjoy!

Video title: Double Dhamaal - Official Trailer
	Video description: The four good-for- nothing jokers from Dhamaal - Roy (Riteish Deshmukh), Manav (Jaaved Jaafery) Adi (Arshad Warsi) and Boman (Ashish Chowdhry) are back again! They are still as stupid and useless as before. Hard work is a strict no no and the only work they have ever done in their lives is to lie down on their backsides and dream about a good life where they have everything without doing anything! And then suddenly they see their old arch enemy - the corrupt Inspector Kabir (Sanjay Dutt). But he's no longer a cop and instead of chasing crooks, he's chasing money - driving a Merc and has a posh office and a lavish villa. The four madcaps are green with envy and decide that come what may, by hook or by crook they will share Kabir's good fortune. And so they blackmail Kabir into making them his business partners. They are in seventh heaven, yippee, all their dreams are coming true. What they don't know is that soon their dreams are going to turn into nightmares because Kabir has his own hidden agenda, only shared by his sultry wife Kamini (Mallika Sherawat) and lovely sister Kiya (Kangna Ranaut). And so starts a game of one- up- manship, with both sides having tricks up their sleeves and where sundry characters like bhai turned sadhu - Batabhai (Satish Kaushik) and King of Casinos Johnny Bonzola, turn up to make the foursome's life miserable. And of course there's a helluva lot of money at stake. There are also lots of twists and turns and a bellyful of laughs. But who will <b>...</b>

	Video description: Goa's first and only global musician Remo Fernandes returns to Bollywood with a brand new avatar of a song he's composed and performed, strumming his guitar at several live gigs. 'Maria Pitache' forms one of the backdrops of the comic-romantic tale of David the fisherman from Goa (2010). Filmed in a shack and depicting the laid-back vibe of the land, Maria Pitache is truly the finest foot-tapping number of the season! Bring out the feni and dancing shoes, we say!

The reason for this is that she does not know who her father is. All she knows is that she is not permitted to talk about him at home. She finds out that her dad is in Seychelles, Nairobi, South Africa, and runs away there. When she gets to Nairobi, she comes to know that her dad, who she has been so anxious to meet, is living with another woman, Swati Sinha, who is married to another male, and her dad is not at all thrilled to have a teenaged daughter come and interrupt his life and affairs.

Video title: Blue Skies to Black Umbrellas - Darryn Lyons
	Video description: Blue Skies to Black Umbrellas. Twelve Driven Australians. One Big City. Darryn Lyons. 'Mr Paparazzi' owns Big Pictures, a celebrity picture agency in London. Created by film-makers David McLagan and Brad Lawson, Blue Skies to Black Umbrellas examines the diverse experiences of twelve unique, highly driven Australians in pursuit of their dreams in London. In a series of candid interviews conducted between 2007 and 2010, the film-makers explore the personal stories behind the diaspora and ask what it is about London that captures imaginations -- and holds them -- despite all the obvious difficulties. (To say nothing about the weather!) The films also examine the notion of "Australianness" and ask how important this complex mindset has been in helping break down social barriers and achieve lofty goals. Often surprising, sometimes controversial, Blue Skies to Black Umbrellas brings into focus a whole new breed of intelligent Australian, determined to reach the very top -- in arguably the world's toughest, most competitive city. And helps put to bed the stereotypical "Earls Court Aussie" once and for all. The twelve films feature: Tim Minchin, Perrier Award Winning Comedian; Lyell Strambi, COO, Virgin Atlantic Airlines; Darryn Lyons, "Mr Paparazzi", Chairman, Big Pictures; Michael Lynch, CEO Southbank Centre, London; Meredith Hooper, Polar Scientist and Author; Ryan Heath, Social Commentator and Political Speechwriter; Kristina Dryza, Futurist; Nikki Gemmell, Broadcaster and <b>...</b>

	Video description: A gritty, white-knuckle, action ride set in the near-future where the sport of boxing has gone high-tech, "Real Steel" stars Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, a washed-up fighter who lost his chance at a title when 2000-pound, 8-foot-tall steel robots took over the ring. Now nothing but a small-time promoter, Charlie earns just enough money piecing together low-end bots from scrap metal to get from one underground boxing venue to the next. When Charlie hits rock bottom, he reluctantly teams up with his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) to build and train a championship contender. As the stakes in the brutal, no-holds-barred arena are raised, Charlie and Max, against all odds, get one last shot at a comeback.

	Video description: Recreating one of our subcontinent's most popular qawwalis wasn't an easy ride, but Team David took it up and created the stunner that is Damadam Mast Kalandar. This video goes behind the scenes into composer Mikey McCleary's studio, charting how he's tried to give the track a unique, Carribean-esque rhythm. It then talks about Director Bejoy's signature idea of pitting a soundtrack against action-packed visuals, in this case both a marriage and a caged wrestling fight. Watch the grace of Sarika come alive to the electro soul of Mikey McCleary.. and don't miss Milind Soman and Nikhil Chinappa in the video!

Also as far as my next Top 10 video goes I'll have that up sometime towards the end of the month, and as always thanks for watching my videos.

Video title: Dredd
	Video description: Synopsis - The future. America is an irradiated wasteland. On its East Coast, running from Boston to Washington DC lies Mega City One a vast, violent metropolis of over 400 million citizens living in perpetual fear. The only ones attempting to impose order in the urban chaos are The Judges. Law enforcers, juries, judges and executioners rolled into one. The epitome of these Judges is Dredd. The Chief Judge gives Dredd a mission. To road test a rookie Judge, the powerful psychic Cassandra Anderson. It is to be a training day. The Judges head for a seemingly routine homicide in the notorious Peach Trees mega-block - a 200 story vertical slum run by the pitiless Ma-Ma clan. When the Judges attempt to arrest one of Ma-Ma's chief henchmen, Ma-Ma shuts down the entire building and orders her clan to hunt the judges down. Our two judges are now caught in a vicious and relentless fight for survival. About Dredd (From comic book to big screen) The future world of Judge Dredd created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra back in 1977 for 2000AD has grown to have a life of its own. With countless stories and characters, it was voted best British comic and Best Comic in the World Ever at the National Comics Awards. Now, the endlessly inventive mind of writer Alex Garland brings DREDD to life as a futuristic neo-noir action film that returns the celebrated character to the dark, visceral incarnation from John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra's revered comic strip.

Video title: Selepas Tsunami 1 of 4
	Video description: Selepas Tsunami (After the Tsunami) - Produced by Big Pictures for Komas about the changes Post March 8, 2008 General Elections for voter and democracy education. The 12th General Election did not only result in the change of government in four states or the lost of Barisan Nasional two-thirds majority in Parliament. It brought along many practices never seen before in the government system. In Selangor, a body under the state assembly was formed to monitor the use of public funds. In the federal Parliament the increasing presence of opposition representatives has resulted in more serious debates. Today, UMNO and Barisan Nasional has started speaking the language of change. However, the real reform process is not as easy as voting on polling day. This documentary discusses the meaning behind those promised changes.

And im puerto rican, so you see the guido. In the background, tell ya boys im back now. see, i was stuck in a different world, smackdown use to bein raw, standin six feet tall. i swear on my supporters i will meet yu all. on the grind since day one, as you became one. of the rest of the competition, now you aint the same one. music is corruption if you dont know how to use it. once you enter your the bomb, until i go and i defuse it. No one makes it big without their own voice. whether its you or your boy thats your own choice my decisions been made, i am on and untamed. im next in line of royalty and ready to reign Now Pick up the pace, you flowing with me now. Always get it in, never catch it on the rebound. Drop you in the water, then ask how the sea sound. Cuz I do what it takes just so I could please crowds. Dropping knowledge like bombs. 1. For every pro theres a con. 2. For every son there's a mom. And a father somewhere don't matter if he's gone. Dropping knowledge like bombs. 3. Girls do nothing for free 4. I can't take it anymore There are many rounds to fight, I aint even keeping score. Download: limelinx.com

Video title: Raavan
	Video description: Raavan is not a story, it is a world. Beera Munda -- Undisputed, Unlawful, Untamed. Dev Pratap Sharma -- The Punisher, The Law, The Righteous Ragini -- Consience, Beauty, Music Dev falls in love with Ragini, a spunky dancer who is as unconventional as him. They get married and he takes up his new post in Lal Maati, a small town in northern India. A town where the word of law is not the police but Beera, a tribal who has, over the years, shifted the power equation of the place from the ruling to the have-nots of the area. Dev knows that the key to bringing order to any place is to vanquish the big fish, in this case -- Beera. In one stroke Dev manages to rip open Beera's world, and set in motion a chain of events which will claim lives, change fortunes. Beera, injured but enraged hits back starting a battle that draws Dev, Beera and Ragini into the jungle. The jungle which is dense, confusing and scary. And in this journey they must confront their own truth. A journey which will test their beliefs, convictions and emotions. Emotions which are as scary and confusing as the forest. The forest becomes the battleground. The battle between good and evil, between Dev and Beera, between Ram and Raavan. But when the lines dividing good and evil are blurring fast whose side will you take. When hate turns to love and good starts looking evil, which side will you battle for? Love is a battle that nobody wins but everyone must fight. Even this Raavan.

	Video description: Deewana is a forthcoming Bengali film directed by Ravi Kinagi starring Jeet and Srabanti in the lead roles. Deewana is a love story of Abhi (Jeet) a funloving and popular boy from Phoolbari, a small township in North Bengal and Shruti (Srabanti) daughter of Agnidev Roy (Bharat Kaul), a dreaded mafia from Kolkata, who sends his daughter to Phoolbari on a vacation. Abhi takes an instant liking for Shruti the moment he sets his eyes on her. Gradually, Shruti starts to enjoy Abhi's company and the fondness between them grows. One day, Abhi finds out that Shruti is suffering from 'post traumatic event disorder' and she has no memory of the last three years.

	Video description: When it comes to being punctual and doing his duties perfectly, Lovely Singh is unmatchable. Taking great pride in what he does, he spares no effort in giving his everything to his profession. Summoned for an assignment of guarding Divya, the daughter of Sartaj Rana, a business tycoon Lovely Singh accompanies her to her campus, but ends up rubbing her the wrong way with his over-protective nature and paranoia about security. She finds him to be a major obstacle in leading a regular campus life. To throw him off-track and get him out of the way, she comes up with a 'master-plan'- that of trapping him in a fake love affair. 'Once he's smitten by the girl of his dreams and is reveling in his new-found romance, he will leave us alone, and we shall be free to do our own thing unhindered', says Divya to her friends. She becomes an anonymous admirer of his and starts hounding him, expressing her 'feelings' in no uncertain terms. Lovely Singh however proves to be a tough nut to crack, and it takes quite a bit of doing from her side to penetrate his fort-like exterior. But once she succeeds in doing so, he transforms into a completely different person. Divya is triumphant and is all set to relish her regained freedom. But things take an unexpected turn when she learns a few things about Lovely Singh. Things that she could've never even imagined!

Video title: Kites *Teaser* Ft Hrithik_Roshan Barbara_Mori - HQ
	Video description: "Kites is a metaphor in the film. Kites fly against the wind and not with it, stronger the wind blows, higher they fly," "Our protagonists in the movie too face obstacles; their love grows deeper with every increasing obstacle," Kites is a compelling romantic saga that goes beyond barriers, boundaries and cultures. It is a story of passion that defies every rule, of a relationship that takes two lovers on a thrilling journey filled with precious moments - and unexpected betrayal. Kites is made in two versions, Hindi and English. Both will release on May 21, 2010 across more than 60 countries.

Video title: Dredd Making -1
	Video description: Synopsis - The future. America is an irradiated wasteland. On its East Coast, running from Boston to Washington DC lies Mega City One a vast, violent metropolis of over 400 million citizens living in perpetual fear. The only ones attempting to impose order in the urban chaos are The Judges. Law enforcers, juries, judges and executioners rolled into one. The epitome of these Judges is Dredd. The Chief Judge gives Dredd a mission. To road test a rookie Judge, the powerful psychic Cassandra Anderson. It is to be a training day. The Judges head for a seemingly routine homicide in the notorious Peach Trees mega-block - a 200 story vertical slum run by the pitiless Ma-Ma clan. When the Judges attempt to arrest one of Ma-Ma's chief henchmen, Ma-Ma shuts down the entire building and orders her clan to hunt the judges down. Our two judges are now caught in a vicious and relentless fight for survival. About Dredd (From comic book to big screen) The future world of Judge Dredd created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra back in 1977 for 2000AD has grown to have a life of its own. With countless stories and characters, it was voted best British comic and Best Comic in the World Ever at the National Comics Awards. Now, the endlessly inventive mind of writer Alex Garland brings DREDD to life as a futuristic neo-noir action film that returns the celebrated character to the dark, visceral incarnation from John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra's revered comic strip.

Video title: Blue Skies to Black Umbrellas - Tim Minchin
	Video description: Blue Skies to Black Umbrellas. Twelve Driven Australians. One Big City. Tim Minchin. Young Australian Achiever of the Year 2011 and Perrier Award Winning Comedian -- and all round great guy. Created by film-makers David McLagan and Brad Lawson, Blue Skies to Black Umbrellas examines the diverse experiences of twelve unique, highly driven Australians in pursuit of their dreams in London. In a series of candid interviews conducted between 2007 and 2010, the film-makers explore the personal stories behind the diaspora and ask what it is about London that captures imaginations -- and holds them -- despite all the obvious difficulties. (To say nothing about the weather!) The films also examine the notion of "Australianness" and ask how important this complex mindset has been in helping break down social barriers and achieve lofty goals. Often surprising, sometimes controversial, Blue Skies to Black Umbrellas brings into focus a whole new breed of intelligent Australian, determined to reach the very top -- in arguably the world's toughest, most competitive city. And helps put to bed the stereotypical "Earls Court Aussie" once and for all. The twelve films feature: Tim Minchin, Perrier Award Winning Comedian; Lyell Strambi, COO, Virgin Atlantic Airlines; Darryn Lyons, "Mr Paparazzi", Chairman, Big Pictures; Michael Lynch, CEO Southbank Centre, London; Meredith Hooper, Polar Scientist and Author; Ryan Heath, Social Commentator and Political Speechwriter; Kristina Dryza, Futurist <b>...</b>

The report also shows deaths and injuries caused by "pro-government forces" (US and NATO troops, Afghan army and police) accounted for 12% of civilian casualties, an 18% drop from the same time period last year. Collected here are images of the country and conflict over the past month, part of an ongoing monthly series on Afghanistan. (43 photos total) SOUND : bethoven 7th symphony 2nd movement allegretto

Today Bollywood is growing at a rate of 9%pa and has a current business of 11000 crores, if B-Town maintains this rate then soon by the end of 2013 it will cover the business of worth 17000 crores. Well this is evident from the big deals as listed below: Fox Star Studios has acquired the worldwide rights of Karan Johar directed My Name Is Khan for Rs 98 crores. This film is co-produced by Dharma Productions and Red Chillies Entertainment and the movie stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol and is slated to release in February next year.

Luck by Chance is a slice of film industry life, in which self advancement is the sole motivator. Here, notions of superstition, fate and destiny may underline every decision but it the gigantic egos, the grand desires and the small opportunities that converge to form strange patterns. Patterns that we call kismet. In such an unpredictable climate, is success and failure what other's define for you or is it something you decide for yourself?

Video title: Paparazzi Documentary next Generation Part 7 Final part
	Video description: Final Part BBC3 Documentary on London paparazzi Part 1 The father and son outfit namely ISO images were conned into misrepresenting the london paparazzi. All figures and prices claimed by them are false. Since the broadcast of this program Ryan Essex and Elliott have gone into hiding. This was also heavily edited to look immoral and cruel towards celebrities. Much of the sequences where swapped over and cut to make things look as bad as possible, example: when the photographer reached for his camera to snap Amy Winehouse while traveling on the dual carriage way.... this actually never happened... he was actually pulling into the McDonalds drive through at around 8MPH, not 70MPH as claimed by the footage. This but to name a few I had a lengthy conversation with Ryan Essex and his father and they regret agreeing to this and have apologized to all london paparazzi for making us look worse than we already are. Lily Allen climbing her fence did not sell for £9000 I have it from Ryan that it was more like £900. I am almost certain that these will provoke debate and no doubt abuse so please open your eyes before you judge....especially if you have a newspaper, magazine or television around you RIGHT NOW!!! And before you say how disgusting we are I'd like to say that the london paparazzi are made up of some of the nicest people, people who have served for england, people who have saved peoples lives by dragging them out of burning cars, devoted fathers and husbands, charity <b>...</b>

Video title: Domenico Gnoli - Pop Art
	Video description: Domenico Gnoli (Roma, 1933 -- New York, 1970) è stato un pittore, illustratore e scenografo italiano. I quadri riprodotti i in questo video in genere sono molto grandi. Quindi piccoli particolari in quadri enormi. Dal 1955 al 1962 visse a New York, lavorando soprattutto come pittore, e giungendo nel 1964 al repertorio per il quale, grazie alla corrispondenza con il gusto e le tematiche della Pop art, ha ottenuto grande fama. Si dedicò allo studio e alla riproduzione fedele dei particolari di oggetti quotidiani ( le trame di un tessuto, una cravatta, una tasca, una scarpa, una manica, un colletto rosso, la scriminatura dei capelli), raffigurazioni realistiche e fortemente ingrandite di dettagli minuti di corpi, capi di vestiario, oggetti isolati dal loro contesto. Gnoli Domenico (Rome, 1933 - New York, 1970) was a painter, illustrator and Italian designer. The paintings reproduced in this video are usually very large. So small parts in big pictures.

Do your own homework check out the facts as we did. You will see it is the truth. We live in an area where elected politicians ignore the needs of their constituents, where the judiciary and police institutions will not uphold the rights of citizens, where the media is afraid to report the truth, where lawlessness abounds and ordinary people are left unprotected and defenceless against the rapacity of a few.

	Video description: A gritty, white-knuckle, action ride set in the near-future where the sport of boxing has gone high-tech, "Real Steel" stars Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, a washed-up fighter who lost his chance at a title when 2000-pound, 8-foot-tall steel robots took over the ring. Now nothing but a small-time promoter, Charlie earns just enough money piecing together low-end bots from scrap metal to get from one underground boxing venue to the next. When Charlie hits rock bottom, he reluctantly teams up with his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) to build and train a championship contender. As the stakes in the brutal, no-holds-barred arena are raised, Charlie and Max, against all odds, get one last shot at a comeback.

Video title: Chemarea - Max Igan (partea 2 din 8)
	Video description: original film : thecrowhouse.com reupload from : www.youtube.com www.peoplestandup.ca -subtitrat în română- În cuvintele autorului "În martie 2009 am fost abordat să creez o versiune combinată şi rezumată a filmelor "Imaginea Generală"(The Big Picture), "Înfruntă Noua Ordine Mondială cu Non conformitate Globală"(Fight The NWO with Global Non Compliance) şi "NWO Soluţia Finală"(NWO The Final Solution). Obiectivul era să concentrez toate cele 3 filme într-o producţie/soluţie de o oră cu apel la o audientă mai largă şi potrivită pentru televiziune. Acest film este rezultatul. Pe lânga material nou, filmul conţine 2 capitole complete din "The Big Picture -Final Cut" neschimbate. Nu am facut asta pentru a "recicla" material vechi ci pentru ca informaţia conţinută în acele capitole era relevantă şi trebuia inclusă. Dacă unii oameni pe care îi cunoşti încă nu văd urgenţa situaţiei mondiale şi au nevoie de informare şi sa acţioneze conform acesteia, sper sincer că acest film le va deschide ochii."

	Video description: Movie: Talaash The powerful voice of Sona Mohapatra, backed by Ravindra Upadhyay, teams up with composer Ram Sampath's magic yet again to create the haunting tune of Jiya Laage Na. It is picturised so to convey the silent but simmering tensions between the film's lead characters Shekhawat (Aamir Khan) and his wife Shreya (Rani Mukhejee). The lyrics have been penned once again by the ever-impactful Javed Akhtar.
